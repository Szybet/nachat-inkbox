* Ancient Matrix client ported to Inkbox that works suprisingly well

old readme file:


This project is in early development and is not yet suitable for regular use.

* Dependencies
  - LMDB
  - Qt >= 5.6

  Qt 5.6 provides extended text layout support nachat relies on to implement clickable URLs in the custom timeline
  widget, and provides superior support for high-DPI displays. Supporting earlier versions is unfortunately not trivial.

* Build Requirements
  - CMake >= 3.1
  - A C++14 compiler and stdlib providing ~std::experimental::optional~ (OSX users need Xcode >= 8)

* Building
  The binary will be output at ~build/src/nachat~ and can be executed in-place. Building on Windows and OSX should be
  possible but is not yet documented.
** Linux
   1. Clone this repository and its submodules:
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Ralith/nachat.git
cd nachat
#+END_SRC
      or
      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/Ralith/nachat.git
cd nachat
git submodule update --init
#+END_SRC
   2. ~cmake -H. -Bbuild~
   3. ~make -C build~
** Nix
   A nix environment is provided. Execute ~nix-shell .~ before ~cmake~.

* Installation
** Using Nix
   ~nix-env -f . -i~ will add ~nachat~ to your path. Development takes place on the ~nixos-unstable~ channel, so
   building on ~nixos-16.03~ may require some tweaking of ~default.nix~.

* Run-time data
** Linux
   Most recent username, homeserver, and access token are stored in Qt INI format at
   ~$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nachat/nachat.conf~. Per-account data, including room state, is cached at
   ~$XDG_CACHE_HOME/nachat/nachat/<hexadecimal form of utf8 encoding of MXID>~.
